# Yet Another Hand Gesture Recognition

In this project, I've aimed to explore new and exciting experiences.

## How it Works

When you run the Python script, it will automatically generate a folder named *"screenshots"* in the current directory. The script will capture and save screenshots when you perform the following hand gestures within 2 seconds:

- ***(🖐🏻)*** Open hand gesture
- ***(✊🏻)*** Closed hand gesture

Additionally, there are other gestures that I'm still working on finding use cases for, such as:

- ***(👍🏻)*** Thumbs up gesture
- ***(✌🏻)*** Victory/Peace gesture
- ***(👌🏻)*** OK hand gesture
- ***(🤘🏻)*** Rock on gesture
- ***(🐺)*** Gesture
- ***(Spiderman Gesture)*** Gesture inspired by Spiderman

#### **Note:** This project is a work in progress, so you may encounter some bugs. Feel free to contribute or provide feedback.
