# Yet Another Hand Gesture Recognition
In this project, I've aimed to do things that I had never experienced before.

## How does it works?
When you start the python script it will automaticaly generate a folder named *"screenshots"* into directory. It'll save the screenshots when you open ***(🖐🏻)*** and close ***(✊🏻)*** your hand within 2 seconds. There's also other gestures that I couldn't be able to find a use case _such as **(👍🏻, ✌🏻, 👌🏻, 🤘🏻, 🐺 Gesture, Spiderman Gesture).**_

#### ***Note:** This projet in WIP so you are probably gonna encounter some bugs*
